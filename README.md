                    Authentication and Authorization Feature 
                        
For the authentication, the users(students) are requested to sign up for an account on the app. While they sign up they are requested to provide their Student ID number, full name, dorm number and password. For the sign up process to be successful the provided  student id must be found in the local database that stores the id of all AAU students along with their names.  After the students have created their account they can log in to the app by providing their id along with their password.

For the authorization, whenever a new account is created a corresponding role will be attached to it. For our mobile app there will be three  authorization levels, first one is for non registered users, the second one is for registered students and the third one is for admins.
