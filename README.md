# AAU_Laundry_System_APP




            AAU_Laundry_System_App:
The AAU laundry system app is the system we aimed to create. Most universities in developed countries provide laundry services to their students, and our university has a laundry facility, but it is not modern and does not correspond to a first generation university. This laundry differs from others in that it only serves AAU students and charges a very low service fee. Students used to face numerous challenges when it came to washing their clothes, and they wasted a significant amount of time while waiting for it to dry. Furthermore, they frequently lost their clothes and had them stolen. The environment was also unsuitable for students with disabilities. For authentication, our system uses the student's ID and provides the service to each student by reaching into their dorms.This helps students because it is going to be cost and time effective. The delivery service, as opposed to the laundry itself, will be free of charge. 



          Authentication and Authorization Feature :
                        
For the authentication, the users(students) are requested to sign up for an account on the app. While they sign up they are requested to provide their Student ID number, full name, dorm number and password. For the sign-up process to be successful, the provided  student ID must be found in the local database that stores the ID of all AAU students along with their names.  After the students have created their account, they can log in to the app by providing their ID along with their password.

For the authorization, whenever a new account is created, a corresponding role will be attached to it. For our mobile app there will be three  authorization levels, first one is for non-registered users, the second one is for registered students and the third one is for admins.
